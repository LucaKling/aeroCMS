# aeroCMS
## What is it?

aeroCMS is a lightweight (not yet finished) Content Management System (using [LucaKling/aeroFramework](https://github.com/LucaKling/aeroFramework)) for websites which is programmed object oriented.

## Features?

There is not much by now, but there are definitely many more features to come.
Gonna give you a short overview: 

* Database based Blog system
* Database based Page System
* Responsive design (Default template will be bootstrap-based)
* More to come later on

## Can I already use this system?

**Nah!** As you don't have the MySQL-dump it is kind of not really working right now. Give me a moment to finish it.
